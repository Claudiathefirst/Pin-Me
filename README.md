# Implement Infinite Scroll Feature

Given a static dataset (JSON) of
Pinterest Pins, design and implement a page that shows all the pins and allows infinite scrolling, reusing
the Pins as needed. The implementation should be done in a modular way so that the rendering of Pins
could be easily reused in other pages and this page could be given other widgets to arrange on the page
and support infinite scrolling.

## How to setup and run this App

To run this app, download the project on your local computer and run the following script.

```
$ cd pin-me
$ npm install
```

Start server and access http://localhost:3000/

```
$ npm run start
```
